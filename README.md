# OxiDash

A small dashboard made with rust and gtk-rs.\
Styling can be done with a css file.\
See style.css for all possible IDs to override.

## Notes

- You need gtk4-layer-shell installed as well as a notification server implementing the following dbus commands:\
   RemoveAllNotifications, DoNotDisturb, RemoveNotification, GetAllNotifications\
  In other words you can use [OxiNoti](https://git.dashie.org/DashieTM/oxinoti)
- This is WIP.
- not much configurability yet
